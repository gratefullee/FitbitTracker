# FitbitTracker
Just a short research for Fitbit Device Data :) 

Fitbit Tracker Dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?datasetId=1041311&searchQuery=ml
The dataset is Fitbit device data from 33 individual users, collected between 3/12/16 and
5/12/16. It has records about their daily physical activities, calories, heartbeats, sleep durations, their log in records for weight updates, and etc.



1. strong linear correlation between total minutes in bed and total minutes of sleep. (r=0.93) 


2. With K-mean clustering, I found users with unhealthy daily routine. They spend time just sitting and sleep significantly less. 


3. For BPM data, a lot of users leave with empty data or just partially recorded. This seems like data deficiency.
